      <h1>The Atari 2600</h1>
      <p>Video games originally started in the arcade and later to home consoles such as the magnavox odyssey or the intellivision, but none were quite as successful as the Atari 2600. The Atari 2600 showed the masses that games could be more than just a hobby, but to many video games were still just a child's toy. The Atari was very simple as far as hardware with the controller only having 1 button and a joy stick. Because of the limited hardware games were very simple and were very short and often the goal was just to get the highest score, but there was no way to save your game so end the end score meant nothing. Atari would never find as much success as all of their later consoles were nothing compared the 2600. Some famous games for the system are Missle command, Frogger, Space Invaders, and Pitfall. Unfortunately there was no quality control so anyone could make any game of any quality, because of this many games were just terrible and is believed to be the main reason for the video game crash.
