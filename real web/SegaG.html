      <h1>Sega Genesis</h1>
      <p>The Sega Genesis also known as the Sega Mega Drive outside of the United States was the follow up 16-bit console to the Sega Master System. Released in the United States in 1989 it was the first massively popular 16-bit console. The Sega Genesis was to compete with the NES and later the SNES.The Sega Genesis was aimed at a slightly older audience than the NES so many games had more violence than their NES counterparts. At the time there was no ESRB so consumers didn't know how violent a game was, games like Mortal Kombat was huge influences on the formation of a rating system on games. The Sega Genesis had 2 expectations or add-ons to the console, the Sega 32X and the Sega CD. Both were considered to be failures, but they had some cool innovations. The 32-X for example made the Genesis a 32-bit console, and the Sega CD used CDs instead of cartridges. Some of the most popular games for the Sega Genesis are Sonic the Hedgehog, Altered Beast, Ristar, and Golden Axe.</p>
