      <h1>The Nintendo Entertainment System</h1>
    <p style="padding:10px;margin:0px;font-size:20px;">
    Depending on who you ask the NES could define the word classic. The Nintendo Entertainment System was released on July 15, 1983 in Japan as the Family Computer or Famicom for short and as the Nintendo Entertainment System or NES in America. It was released with the game Super Mario bros/Duck hunt and it was a massive success. Before games only lasted a few minutes start to finish if you knew what you were doing ,but now with better hardware and memory capabilities games could last over an hour. The NES also introduced quality control with the NES with the Nintendo Seal of approval this meant that games had to meet a threshold of quality to be published. It is believed that the lack of quality control on past consoles is what caused the Video game crash, a period where home gaming was in a rapid decline as a passing fad, but many believe that Nintendo single handedly restored the home gaming industry. Some of the famous title include Super mario bros, Duck hunt, Mega Man, Castlevania, Contra, Battletoads, Duck Tails, Metroid, and many more iconic games.  </p>
